Access by Key -> The unordered nature of hash tables is what makes dictionaries so efficient for data retrieval.By using a hash function, Python can quickly locate the memory location of a value based on its key, without having to iterate through the entire dictionary.This results in near-constant-time lookups (O(1) on average).\n",
